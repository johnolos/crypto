\begin{abstract}
A good pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is an essential ingredient in
creating a secure cryptographic system. The output numbers of those number
generators are used futher in encrypting and decrypting messages.
Since the process of generating these numbers is deterministic a security
system will have a major security breach if those numbers produced are
predictable either by having a predictable output pattern or simply
do not have a "random" enough seed input for it's number generation.
The goal is to have an easy to produce pseudorandom number generator than
generates numbers as close to random as possible.
There is essentially a tradeoff between having a complicated good PRNG and
having a PRNG that is fast, but also secure enough to use in production.

\medskip
For our project we aim to create our own pseudorandom number generator which
is fast in computation and generates reasonable results to be used in
production. Our PRNG will have seed input gathered from various sources. The
input seed will not be random, but will have an unpredictable pattern.
Our motive is not to come up with a groundbreaking algorithm that exceeds
already implemented algorithms, but to see if we can come up with an algorithm
that is good enough to obtain some level of security.

\medskip
When we have a working PRNG we will test the produced numbers and see if we
have managed to create an algorithm that produces close to statistically
random numbers.
