\section{Conclusion}
Two tests have been implemented and used on both our own implementation of a pseudorandom number generator and Java's built-in pseudorandom generator. In the first test, the Runs test, both algorithms did well and showed a result close to the expected result. In the original test described by Marsaglia, it states that the numbers generated should be floats in the range (0,1). Our version has random integers in range $[0, 2^{31})$. In the second test, the minimum distance test, our implementation did differ more significantly from the expected value of the mean of the square of the minimum distance. In comparison Java's random generator performed slightly better in our test. We measured the execution times of both tests for both implementations and there is no significant difference between them in the Runs test. In the minimum distance test our implementation was slightly faster than Java's random generator.
