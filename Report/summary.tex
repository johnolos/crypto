\section{Summary}
In this paper we have studied the implementation of a pseudorandom number generator, in particular the xorshift* algorithm. The algorithm is fast and use less memory space compared to other generators. We have described our implementation and we have tested and analyzed the results from the tests. We implemented two tests, the Runs test and the minimum distance test. Both described by George Marsaglia as a part of a battery of tests designed to test random generators. Our goal with this project was not to implement something better than what exists today, but rather to implement something "good enough" compared to other methods. That being said, based on the tests, we are happy with the result.
